# Hotel

## Learning Goals

Reinforce and practice all of the Ruby and programming concepts we've covered in class so far:
- Design a system using object-oriented principles
- Create and instantiate classes with attributes
- Create class and instance methods within our classes
- Write pseudocode and create tests to drive the creation of our code

This is a [stage 3](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/pedagogy/blob/master/rule-of-three.md), individual project.

## Introduction

Your company has been contracted to build a booking system for a small hotel. This system will be used by employees working at the front desk, and will not be available to the general public.

This system will have two parts: a user interface that runs in the terminal, and a module full of business logic, classes and methods that keep track of which rooms are reserved when. **Your job is to implement the business logic only.** You do **not** need to build a CLI for this project.

Instead, you will use tests to verify your part of the system works as intended.

### Expectations

This project is both a culmination of our Intro to Ruby unit and our first stage 3 project. This means the requirement are more open-ended and ambiguous than previous projects you have worked on. This is intentional. You will be expected to:

- Make decisions on how to structure your classes and methods
- Ask questions when you need clarification
- Understand that the way you implement something may be different than the way your neighbor implements it

**It is possible you will not be able to complete all requirements.** Though all 3 waves will be visible at the beginning of the project, they are organized by difficulty and relevance to the learning goals, and should be tackled in order.

### Setup

We will use the same project structure we used for the previous project. Classes should be in files in the `lib` folder, and tests should be in files in the `specs` folder. You should utilize a spec helper file. You will run tests by executing the `rake` command, as configured in a Rakefile.

1. Fork this repository in GitHub
1. Clone the repository to your computer
1. Create/copy a rakefile to run your tests
1. Create the `specs/spec_helper.rb` file to load your classes and start `simplecov`. This file will load all the required gems and source files your spec files need so they only need to require the helper.
    - Each of your spec files should `require_relative` the spec helper file.
1. Create a test to check the instantiation of one of your object types (**RED**)
1. Create the class for the object tested in the step above (**GREEN**)
1. Use `git add`, `commit` and `push` commands to push your initial code to GitHub

### Process

You should use the following process as much as possible:

1. Write pseudocode
1. Write test(s)
1. Write code
1. Commit

You should have **95% code coverage** using `simplecov`.

Your git commit history should provide a clear description of how your code developed, letting the reader know what changed when and why.

## Wave Zero: Project Design

This will be an in-class activity.

## Wave One: Tracking Reservations

Remember that your job is only to build the classes that store information and handle business logic, and the tests to verify they're behaving as expected. Building a user interface is not part of this project!

### User Stories

- As an administrator, I can access the list of all of the rooms in the hotel
- As an administrator, I can reserve a room for a given date range
- As an administrator, I can access the list of reservations for a specific date
- As an administrator, I can get the total cost for a given reservation

### Constraints

- The hotel has 20 rooms, and they are numbered 1 through 20
- Every room is identical, and a room always costs $200/night
- The last day of a reservation is the checkout day, so the guest should not be charged for that night
- For this wave, any room can be reserved at any time, and you don't need to check whether reservations conflict with each other (this will come in wave 2!)

### Error Handling

- Your code should raise an error when an invalid date range is provided

### Hints

- You might want to investigate [Ruby's `Date` gem](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html).

## Wave Two: Room Availability

### User Stories

- As an administrator, I can view a list of rooms that are not reserved for a given date range
- As an administrator, I can reserve an available room for a given date range

### Constraints

- A reservation is allowed start on the same day that another reservation for the same room ends

### Error Handling

- Your code should raise an exception when asked to reserve a room that is not available

## Wave Three: Blocks of Rooms

If you are not familiar with what a block of hotel rooms, here is a brief description:

> A Block Booking refers to a group of rooms set aside for a specific group of customers for a set period of time.
>
> Room blocks are commonly created for large events like weddings or conventions. A number of rooms are set aside, and are made available for reservation by certain customers at a discounted rate. These rooms are not available to be reserved by the general public.

### User Stories

- As an administrator, I can create a block of rooms
    - To create a block you need a date range, collection of rooms and a discounted room rate
    - The collection of rooms should only include rooms that are available for the given date range
    - If a room is set aside in a block, it is not available for reservation by the general public, nor can it be included in another block
- As an administrator, I can check whether a given block has any rooms available
- As an administrator, I can reserve a room from within a block of rooms

### Constraints

- A block can contain a maximum of 5 rooms
- When a room is reserved from a block of rooms, the reservation dates will always match the date range of the block
- All of the availability checking logic from Wave 2 should now respect room blocks as well as individual reservations

## Optional Enhancements

You should not be working on these (or even thinking about them) until you have fully completed wave 3.

- Allow a user to set different rates for different rooms
- Read/write CSV files for each piece of data that your system is storing
- Create a CLI to interact with your hotel system
